OCR Demo
========

This folder contains a demo I coded for a pattern recognition class. The demo (draw.m)
creates a GUI and allows the user to draw a number in an area on the window. A simple kNN
classifier is then used to classify the digit that was drawn using data from the UCI
handwritten digits dataset.
